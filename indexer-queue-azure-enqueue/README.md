# os-indexer-queue-azure

os-indexer-queue-azure is a spring boot service that is woken up in response to messages emitted by `os-storage-azure` onto Service Bus. It is responsible for calling the `os-indexer` to trigger re-indexing events.

## Running Locally

### Requirements

In order to run this service locally, you will need the following:

- [Maven 3.6.0+](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- [AdoptOpenJDK8](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)

### General Tips

**Environment Variable Management**

The following tools make environment variable configuration simpler


* [direnv](https://direnv.net/) - for a shell/terminal environment
* [EnvFile](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7861-envfile) - for [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)


**Lombok**

This project uses [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) for code generation. You may need to configure your IDE to take advantage of this tool.
 - [Intellij configuration](https://projectlombok.org/setup/intellij)
 - [VSCode configuration](https://projectlombok.org/setup/vscode)


### Environment Variables

In order to run the service locally, you will need to have the following environment variables defined in your `.env` file.

**Note** The following command can be useful to pull secrets from keyvault:
```bash
az keyvault secret show --vault-name $KEY_VAULT_NAME --name $KEY_VAULT_SECRET_NAME --query value -otsv
```

### Configure Maven

Check that maven is installed:
```bash
$ mvn --version
Apache Maven 3.6.0
Maven home: /usr/share/maven
Java version: 1.8.0_212, vendor: AdoptOpenJDK, runtime: /usr/lib/jvm/jdk8u212-b04/jre
...
```

You will need to configure access to the remote maven repository that holds the OSDU dependencies. This file should live within `~/.m2/settings.xml`:
```bash
$ cat ~/.m2/settings.xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
          xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
    <servers>
        <server>
            <id>os-core</id>
            <username>mvn-pat</username>
            <!-- Treat this auth token like a password. Do not share it with anyone, including Microsoft support. -->
            <!-- The generated token expires on or before 11/14/2019 -->
            <password>$PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN_GOES_HERE</password>
        </server>
    </servers>
</settings>
```

### Build and run the application

Build and run the application
After configuring your environment as specified above, you can follow these steps to build and run the application. These steps should be invoked from the repository root.

# build + test + package azure service code
$ cd indexer-queue-azure-enqueue && mvn clean package

# run service
#
# Note: this assumes that the environment variables for running the service as outlined
#       above are already exported in your environment.
$ mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local   
# or directly run the jar file  
$ cd indexer-queue-azure-enqueue && java -jar target\indexer-queue-azure-enqueue-1.0.0-spring-boot.jar

### Test the application
```# build + install integration test core
   $ (cd testing/indexer-queue-azure-enqueue/ && mvn clean install)
   
   # build + run Azure integration tests.
   #
   # Note: this assumes that the environment variables for integration tests as outlined above are already exported in your environment.
   $ (cd testing/indexer-queue-azure-enqueue/ && mvn clean test)
```

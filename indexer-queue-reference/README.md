# Indexer-queue-reference

indexer-queue-reference is a service that is woken up in response to messages emitted by os-storage onto Service Bus. It is responsible for calling the os-indexer to trigger re-indexing events.
This service could be used for OSDU hybrid cloud.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
 
### Prerequisites
 
- [Maven 3.6.0+](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- [AdoptOpenJDK8](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)
- [Lombok 1.16 or later](https://projectlombok.org/setup/maven)
- [GCloud SDK with java (latest version)](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
 
### Installation

- Setup Apache Maven
- Setup AdoptOpenJDK
- Setup GCloud SDK
- Install Eclipse (or other IDE) to run applications
- Set up environment variables for Apache Maven and AdoptOpenJDK. For example M2_HOME, JAVA_HOME, etc.
- Add a configuration for build project in Eclipse(or other IDE)

### Run Locally

In order to run the service locally or remotely, you will need to have the following environment variables defined.

| name | value | description | sensitive? | source |
| ---  | ---   | ---         | ---        | ---    |
| `OSDU_ENTITLEMENTS_URL` | ex `https://entitlements.com/entitlements/v1` | Entitlements API endpoint | no | output of infrastructure deployment |
| `SERVICE_MAIL` | ex `service@osdu.iam.gserviceaccount.com` | Indexer Queue Service mail with which token will be created for cloud tasks must match with variable in `INDEXER_QUEUE_SERVICE_MAIL` Indexer Service | no | - |
| `INDEXER_HOST` | ex `https://indexer.a.run.app` | Indexer Service host  | no | output of infrastructure deployment |
| `GOOGLE_AUDIENCES` | ex `*****.apps.googleusercontent.com` | Client ID for getting access to cloud resources | yes | https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials |
| `PARTITION_API` | ex `http://localhost:8081/api/partition/v1` | Partition service endpoint | no | - |
| `MB_RABBITMQ_URI` | ex `amqp://guest:guest@127.0.0.1:5672` | MessageBroker RabbitMQ URI | yes | output of infrastructure deployment |

Check that maven is installed:

```bash
$ mvn --version
Apache Maven 3.6.0
Maven home: /usr/share/maven
Java version: 1.8.0_212, vendor: AdoptOpenJDK, runtime: /usr/lib/jvm/jdk8u212-b04/jre
...
```

You may need to configure access to the remote maven repository that holds the OSDU dependencies. This file should live within `~/.mvn/community-maven.settings.xml`:

```bash
$ cat ~/.m2/settings.xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
          xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
    <servers>
        <server>
            <id>community-maven-via-private-token</id>
            <!-- Treat this auth token like a password. Do not share it with anyone, including Microsoft support. -->
            <!-- The generated token expires on or before 11/14/2019 -->
             <configuration>
              <httpHeaders>
                  <property>
                      <name>Private-Token</name>
                      <value>${env.COMMUNITY_MAVEN_TOKEN}</value>
                  </property>
              </httpHeaders>
             </configuration>
        </server>
    </servers>
</settings>
```

* Update the Google cloud SDK to the latest version:

```bash
gcloud components update
```
* Set Google Project Id:

```bash
gcloud config set project <YOUR-PROJECT-ID>
```

* Perform a basic authentication in the selected project:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

## Testing
* Navigate to Indexer-queue service root folder and run:
 
```bash
mvn clean install   
```

* If you wish to see the coverage report then go to testing/target/site/jacoco-aggregate and open index.html

* If you wish to build the project without running tests

```bash
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

After configuring your environment as specified above, you can follow these steps to build and run the application. These steps should be invoked from the *repository root.*

```bash
cd indexer-queue-reference && mvn spring-boot:run
```
